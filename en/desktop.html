          Computer programming is the provision of various commands to the computer's microprocessor, commands about when, where to change what, and what to enter or output. This article explains what programming languages are, the most common programming languages, and their differences. We will also talk about how to learn programming in the computer world, there are many programming languages, and the number of people interested in programming and its use is growing. Programs that perform the same type of work can be written in Basic, Pascal, Ci, and other languages. The Pascal, Fortran, and COBOL languages are considered universal languages, while the Ci and assembly languages are languages much closer to mashi, and are lower-or intermediate-level languages. The closer an algorithmic language is to human languages, the language is called a high-level language. Machine language, however, is the lowest-level language. Machine language consists of numbers such as: 010110100010101 programming languages are divided into 2 large groups, low-level and high-level programming language. the lower-level programming language is much more complex, they are used in very specific areas, and their specialists are also very rare. because low-level programming languages (such as assembler) can often be necessary when working with microprocessors. A high-level programming language is usually widely used for various programming tasks. the computer (electronic computer) is now included in the compilation of the program at the time of its occurrence only in machine languages, that is, in the codes of actions that the computer must perform with the help of numbers. In this case, the number system that is understandable for the machine is the number system 2, 6, 8. The program is entered using numbers in this number system. In high-level programming, languages in character codes are considered more machine-oriented than machine languages. The basic principles of character-coded languages are that machine codes are defined by their corresponding characters, and include automatic memory allocation and error diagnostics. Such a machine is called an adaptive language-assembly language. programming is usually done using high-level programming languages (delphi, java, c++, python). This makes the process of creating programs much easier due to the proximity of the semantics of programming languages to the human language. Frequently used programming languages. All the languages we know and use now belong to this group. They are written in a language that is" understandable " to a person. Good English language experts can easily understand the program code. This group includes Fortran, Algol, C, Pascal, Cobol, and X. K. languages are included (many of which are currently almost unused). You can use from the very first languages that appeared to the most modern ones. But in languages that work using modern web technologies(PHP, ASP.NET, JSP) such programs are not compiled. Because in order for such applications to work, it is necessary for another application to work. Currently, applications are compiled mainly in languages such as Visual C++, C#, Borland Delphi, Borland C++, Java, and Fixon. In Uzbekistan, many people use Delphi. The main reason: simplicity, a large number of components, clear interface, etc. Even a person who first worked on Delphi, it will be easy to create a program. But the main essence of the program in Windows knows much later (so that the program does not display a large number of components and API functions). on the other hand, delphi(pascal) is a lot lame when it comes to saving ram. It also contains unused variables and arrays in exchange for declaring variables in advance. The most common programming language (in Windows ida) is Microsoft Visual C++. Most programs are currently compiled in this language. In general, C-like (C-like) languages are currently leaders in programming. Almost all modern languages are based on C. In addition, the LUA script or JavaScript languages are also widely used to create various computer games or to create small programs. We will tell you about some of the most common programming languages currently used in desktop programming: Delphi (talaff. DELFI is one of the programming languages. Produced by Borland. It uses the Delphi programming language and was previously part of the Borland Delphi package. Along with this, from 2003 to the present time, the same name is used. Object Pascal is an object-oriented programming language that comes from the Pascal language with several extensions and additions. Initially, this programming environment was intended only for creating applications for the Microsoft Windows operating system, and then was adapted for GNU/Linux and Kylix systems, but after the release of Kylix 3 in 2002, production was discontinued, and soon after Microsoft.NET it was announced that it would maintain its system. The Lazarus Project practice (Free Pascal) programming language allows you to create applications for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows S platforms in the Delphi programming environment. Visual Basic (pronunciation: "Visual Basic" is a programming language from Microsoft Corporation and a programming environment for it. It got a lot of ideas from Basic and provides application progress with a fast GUI. The latest version 6.0 was released in 1998. The successor to Microsoft's Visual Basic .NET appeared in 2002 . The Java programming language is one of the best programming languages in which you can create enterprise-level products(programs).This programming language is based on the Oak programming language. the oak programming language was launched by sun microsystems in the early 90s with the goal of creating a new generation of intelligent devices that work independently of the platform(operating system). to achieve this, sun employees planned to use c++, but for some reason abandoned this idea.oak failed, and in 1995 sun changed its name to java, making certain changes so that it could serve the development of the www. Java is an object-oriented programming language (OOP-object-oriented programming), and it is very similar to C++.The Java programming language has been greatly simplified by removing the parts that cause the most common errors. Files that contain Java code (*.Java end) after compilation, the byte passes into code (bytecode), and this bytecode is read by the interpreter. C++ (pronunciation: si plus plus) is a programming language for various purposes. Bell Labs was developed by Biarne Stroustrup in 1979 with the goal of expanding the capabilities of the C programming language and introducing the OOP(object Oriented Programming) function. Originally called "C with Classes", it was renamed C++in 1983. C++ can compile programs written in C, but the C compiler does not have this feature. The C++ language is used to develop objects related to operating systems, client-server applications, exhibition games, applications for everyday needs, and much more.
